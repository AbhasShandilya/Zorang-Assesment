The straight-line distance between two sets of coordinates is calculated using the calculate_distance function.
From a list of remaining locations, the nearest_neighbor function determines which place is closest to a given location.

Until every address is covered, the generate_routes function iterates through each agent, chooses the closest neighbour for delivery, and changes the routes.
The result is a list of lists, each sublist representing a delivery agent's path.
